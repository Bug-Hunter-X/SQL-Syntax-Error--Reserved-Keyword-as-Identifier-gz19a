This repository demonstrates a common SQL error involving the use of reserved keywords as identifiers.  The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` shows the corrected version. The error arises from the fact that SQL keywords are not allowed as identifier names unless properly escaped with backticks.  This example highlights best practices for naming tables and columns to avoid syntax errors. The solution involves careful naming convention or escaping reserved words with backticks.
