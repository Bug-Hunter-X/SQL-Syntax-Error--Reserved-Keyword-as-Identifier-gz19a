In SQL, a common error is using reserved keywords as identifiers (e.g., table or column names).  This often leads to syntax errors. For example, using `SELECT table FROM table` will fail because `table` is a reserved word. To resolve this, always use backticks (`) to enclose identifiers that conflict with keywords.  For instance, `SELECT `table` FROM `table` will correctly refer to the table named "table."
